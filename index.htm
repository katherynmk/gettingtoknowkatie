<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p2> I am from Munster Indiana. GO HOOSIERS! But I do live in a city close to Lewis. I live with my momma and my lil bro and my lil sis. My brother is in high-school so he is pretty cool.
My sister is young and super annoying. I have worked on computers my whole life. It started off with helping my dad fix the hardware of computers
when I was a kid. Then in middle school I won the applied technology awards. In high-school I took many hardware and software classes. All of this
leads to my dream of being in Cybersecurity. I want to work for the government someday; do something to protect my country. I am a freshman at Lewis and it
has been my dream to go here ever since I stepped onto campus. I am super happy with the way this course is going so far and I am learning so much. Im
excited that we are learning many different types of coding instead of just one. This seems like the perfect intro into my career. This class gets me
excited about the life choices I am making. At first I was hesitant to go into this major, but as I work more and more I realize that this is my passion.   </p2>

<h3> What I Hope To Learn In This Course: </p3>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Computer Hardware</li>
  <li>Computer Software</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<h3> My Favorite Hobby </h3>
<p3> My favorite hobby is probably cars. I dont know that much about them or how to fix them, but I still have
 a passion. I had a Chevy Impala for a long time and I hated it. It was old and the color was gross and It 
didn't run perfect. But ooooooooooooooh it was fast. The police used to use this type of car and some still do.
Right now I have a Dodge and I love it. I love modifying cars. I love to learn about how to do that myself.
I have a muffler modification right now. I want to do a custome dual exhaust. I want to wrap it. I have new
rims and a radar. I go to a lot of car meets. I hangout with people who care about their cars. This stuff is really
interesting to me. When I become a Cybersecurity specialist I will buy all the cars.
